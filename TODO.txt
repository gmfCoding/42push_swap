Stages:
1.0: push all integer larger than M into (B)
1.1: calculate the new M for later use 
2.0: push from largest to smallest from (B) into (A)
REPEAT


Although my logic follows through for needing to find the largest/smallest numbers at each n/4
It seems to be quite the difficult challenge, the easiest way would be to order the list in a "simulation"
but that feels kinda icky.

Finding the median is also a very similar problem.

The other thing we could try for stage 1
